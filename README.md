# AlarmApp

This Alarm App has one button on the screen which keeps setting alarm at every tap on a 10 sec interval.
For example: on clicking Set Alarm, if the first alarm is scheduled at 4:10 then on further clicks, next alarm is scheduled at 4:20, 4:30 and so on..

Everytime the alarm goes off, it triggers a notification along with playing the default ringtone to notify the user of the ringing alarm.

Now this notification contains two action buttons:
- Snooze: The ringing alarm will be dismissed and a new alarm will be scheduled at a 5 seconds interval.
- Dismiss: The ringing alarm will be dismissed.
